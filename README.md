# Manhattan For Rent

This repository collects and makes available the tables that make up the appendix of _Manhattan for Rent_, by Elizabeth Blackmar (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1989).
The data is collected from public sources from the nineteenth century, and here we provide digital versions of the data for use in future projects, digital or otherwise.

The editing and compilation was done by Moacir P. de Sá Pereira and Jeremiah Trinidad-Christensen.

Here are our current goals:

1. Create an entry on Academic Commons called “_Manhattan for Rent_
Appendix” and made up of the various pieces described below.

2. Retypeset the tables so that they look identical (and have the
sources and footnotes) as they do in the book but are born digital. We
would include this pdf and the source TeX file for typesetting it.

3. Extract from the tables “raw” data (that is, taking only the data
that are not derived from other data in the table, as totals or
percentages are) and make those available as spreadsheets.

4. Compile a document describing where the data came from (with links
to digital copies of the various sources if we can find them),
re-enumerating the various footnotes, and describing the various
columns. This would be a combination README and Codebook.

5. Add, if we can find the data, era-specific digital boundary files
for the various wards of New York, so that it would be possible to
make digital maps of New York with the data you collected. Or at least
links to those files.
